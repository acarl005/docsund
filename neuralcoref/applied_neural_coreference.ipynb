       " Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.\n",

       " Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors \"in smoke filled rooms\", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n",
       " \n",
       " Price caps are almost never the right answer\n",
       " Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\n",
       " Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer\n",
       " Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\n",
       " Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West\n",
       " \n",
       " This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray\n",

       " Phillip et al.,\n",
       " \n",
       " I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in \n",
       " the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \n",
       " March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \n",
       " over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \n",
       " temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \n",
       " into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \n",
       " compared with the previous year.\n",
       " \n",
       " Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \n",
       " reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \n",
       " forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \n",
       " total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \n",
       " This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \n",
       " more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \n",
       " decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \n",
       " retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \n",
       " is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \n",
       " year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \n",
       " Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \n",
       " are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \n",
       " meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \n",
       " economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \n",
       " make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\n",
       " \n",
       " Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \n",
       " only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \n",
       " (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \n",
       " portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \n",
       " demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \n",
       " you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \n",
       " smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \n",
       " least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \n",
       " wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \n",
       " mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \n",
       " sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \n",
       " how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \n",
       " Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \n",
       " economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \n",
       " the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \n",
       " think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \n",
       " realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \n",
       " non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \n",
       " WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \n",
       " 6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\n",
